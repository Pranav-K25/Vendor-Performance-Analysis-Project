# Vendor-Performance-Analysis-Project
# Vendor Performance Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing vendor performance using a combination of data engineering, exploratory data analysis, and business intelligence tools. It aims to help stakeholders understand how different vendors contribute to overall business outcomes, identify high-performing vendors, and flag underperformers for strategic intervention.

The dataset used includes vendor-level sales and operational data such as transaction volumes, sales revenue, and other performance indicators. Through a structured pipeline involving data ingestion, summary generation, and in-depth analysis, the project delivers actionable insights into vendor behavior and trends.

The project is divided into the following key components:

- **Data Ingestion and Processing**: Raw data from CSV files is cleaned and structured for further analysis. Python scripts are used to automate ingestion and compute vendor-wise summaries.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Using Python and Jupyter Notebooks, the dataset is explored to understand patterns, outliers, and correlations among various performance metrics.

- **Performance Analysis**: A detailed breakdown of vendor performance is done based on multiple KPIs such as sales volume, consistency, and growth trends. This helps in identifying the top and bottom tier vendors.

- **Visualization and Reporting**: A Power BI dashboard is created to allow interactive exploration of vendor metrics across time periods and categories. A final PDF report summarizes the findings and provides strategic recommendations.

This end-to-end project combines scripting, analytics, and dashboarding to provide a holistic view of vendor performance and supports data-driven decision making for vendor management.
